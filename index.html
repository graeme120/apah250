      <h1>APAH 250 Hunt</h1>
      <p>
        My Senior year of high school, I took a class called AP Art History,
        taught by Ms. Ellen Powers. The curriculum was structured around 250
        works of global art history, colloquially known as 'the 250'. After
        discovering someone had made an (incomplete)
        <a
          href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=16JCCln9_srXbN5XbBVhi7vmKak8&hl=en_US&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C0&z=1"
          >map of the 250,</a
        >
        I decided to make it a life goal to see each artwork in person. The goal
        is not completion ( that is technically impossible.. thanks
        <i>Stone Breakers</i> ), but about the journey. Each of the artworks you
        see in this database has a story attached to it, and finding the
        remaining works will surely yield better ones.

        I dedicate this project to the pursuit of art, the preservation of
        history, and the immutable strength of the human will.
